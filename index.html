  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup code for web pages and  describes the structure of a Web page. HTMl is a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content. <br> I took this class because I like to learn about things I can do with computers. I think that learing how to make a web page would fun snd useful. This class also teaches me some coding.</p>
